                <h2>Darrell Liles</h2><br><br>
                <p id="aboutInfo">Hello my name is Darrell Liles and I am a web design and development student at Full Sail University. I love sketching out ideas and watching them come to life with clean and beautifully written code. This site will serve as a component library where I can store design inspirations that will help me to grow in my career.</p>

            <!-- Component 1 -->
            <article id="component1">
                <h1>Header</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/53156.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Header.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience is for motorcycle owners or those that may be looking to own a motorcycle.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be simple and easy to navigate which is beneficial for the client and user. If users can navigate the site easy they may stay on the site long enough to make a purchase. The contacts for social media, which is normally seen in the footer is located here inside the header. This allows the user to immediately connect more with the client without scrolling the page.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange that is being used in the header gives off warmth and happiness, combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow. This makes it agressive creating a call to action. The white fonts being used balances the orange by giving off a clean and pure feel.</p>
            </article>
            
            <!-- Component 2 -->
            <article id="component2">
                <h1>Header</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54802.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Header2.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who practice hinduism and would like a place to worship.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be subtle and not to take the users attention away from the info given on the home screen. This is why the background is transparent.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange is being used as a attention grabber as the background of the home link. As you hover over the rest of the nav bar you see more orange. The orange is optimistic and uplifting. and gives off an inviting feel. The white font is also used here which represents cleanliness and purity.</p>
            </article>
            
			<!-- Component 3 -->
            <article id="component3">
                <h1>CTA</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/52490.html"><img src="../WSP/images/CTA.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who are athletic and participate physical sports.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The use of the CTA is designed so that the background color would not distract the user from the reading the Tag Line. Once you hover over the button the background color shows up. The technique is called a ghost button.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color blue that shows up once the button is being hovered over represents trust. </p>

            <article id="component4">
                <h1>Features</h1>
                <a href=" http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54826.html"><img src="../WSP/images/features.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The audience being targeted here are those who are hardcore fishers.  </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>While the design appears to be nice looking, I think the pictures in the back should be a little more visible for the user.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The blue color used immediately draws the attention of the user against a black background. The blue gives off a dependable feeling which is needed when the customer begins to view products. </p>
            </article>
            
			<!-- Component 5 -->
            <article id="component5">
                <h1>About Page</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54893.html"><img src="../WSP/images/About.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Target audience for this about section is likely to consist of professionals  who are looking for a quick way to get in contact with the company. </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for Creative Department are the same as most design agencies. They are looking to generate more revenue while building a larger customer base and creating a trustworthy/reliable end product. Their users are typically looking for new branding. Their needs will range greatly but they will all be looking for a design/branding that is high quality and conveys the message they are looking to create.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This is a very simple a straightforward contact form. It has a white background (adding to the simplicity and clean look) and black type mixxed with some green type (which correlates to their brand identity). The layout of the form is set up in a simple and hierarchy which first asks for their name and email, then the message the user is trying communicate, followed by a captcha and a send message button. One thing I really appreciate about the design of this component is the use of the new I'm not a robot checkbox captcha instead of the old style of using barely legible font that the user has to type out to submit something.</p>

            <article id="component6">
                <h1>Blog</h1>
                <a href=" http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54013.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Blog.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>POSHCSS is a web blog targeting web designers. They post stories from many different sources with information on web design. There is no target gender for POSHCSS. The title of their site, "For the modern day web designer," leads me to believe that the target age of their audience is younger web designers. But based off of the information that they post, their audience could be any web designer, young or old.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The central client need for POSHCSS is community outreach. They are a website dedicated to spreading information about web design. Their main focus is creating quality content and sharing it with as many people as possible. The user needs information and the latest news on web design. They are looking for quality content with useful information.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this blog is simplicity and ease of use. It accomplishes just that. The colors are very simple; a white background with black text. The links are blue to let the user know it can be clicked (adding to the ease of use). There is a very nice hierarchy set up as well. The user is presented with a big bold title for the website's name and a smaller type describing what the website is for. There are two black lines below that to create a separation from the title and the content of the site. The type is then broken up into different sizes to distinguish between the title of the piece and the content itself.</p>

			<!-- Component 7 -->
            <article id="component7">
                <h1>Contact</h1>
                <a href=" http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54893.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Contact.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>MailChimp is a tool that allows people to design visual/creative emails. Their target audience is businesses. They offer a tool that can help them visually convey the company's idea or message. There is not target gender for MailChimp. The target age of their audience is, once again, people old enough to be in business.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs are positive customer service and outreach. They want to offer their service to as many people as they can while continuing to create an easy to use quality service. The user needs are simple. They are looking to create visually beautiful emails with as little work as possible.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>Simplicity is the idea behind this login form. They offer the required fields, let the user know they are required, and allow the user to recover their information if they forgot something. While the form is designed to be simple, there are some great features added to it as well. The form allows the user to show their password to make sure they typed it correctly (which not many forms allow you to do). They also offer the feature to stay logged in. This is all set up in an easy to follow hierarchy. The background is white and the type is black and grey which adds to the simplicity and clean look of the form. The type is a sans-serif which helps create a modern clean look.</p>

                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54985.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Login.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Creative Department is another design agency. Their target audience is small businesses looking to create friendly approachable branding. They do not have a target gender for their work. The target age for their audience is people old enough to work at/own a business.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for Creative Department are the same as most design agencies. They are looking to generate more revenue while building a larger customer base and creating a trustworthy/reliable end product. Their users are typically looking for new branding. Their needs will range greatly but they will all be looking for a design/branding that is high quality and conveys the message they are looking to create.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this component is to help the user find where this company is located. The component presents the user with a map and a pointer indicating the exact location of their office. This visual can really help people figure out where to find the company and what is located around it. Below the map is a dark grey section (correlating to the branding of the site) with a white and light grey type. The type is a sans-serif which all comes together to create a clean and easy to read look and feel.</p>

			<!-- Component 9 -->
            <article id="component9">
                <h1>Registration</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54985.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Registration.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Google+'s news feed is designed to deliver the latest news from your friends and companies that you follow. Their target audience is everyone, people of any age and companies of any kind. The purpose of a social media site is to reach as many people as you can no matter race, gender, or age.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for Google+ are creating positive customer service but more importantly, creating a larger community. They want as many people and businesses to use their service as possible. The user needs are pretty straightforward. They are looking to update themselves with the latest news from the family, friends, and the businesses they follow. All they need is a simple and intuitive layout to read this content.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of a news feed is simplicity and legibility. Google+ presents the user with just that. The background is a light grey (adding to the simplicity). Each news piece is a white box usually containing an image and some text. The type is a black sans-serif adding to the clean simple look while keeping things easy to read. All of this translates to the idea of giving the user the news they want and doing so as simply and as quickly as possible.</p>

			<!-- Component 10 -->
            <article id="component10">
                <h1>Footer</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/49667.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Footer.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>This is a personal website for a designer by the name Jarad Johnson. It leads you to two companies that he co-founded. One is a design firm and the other a web hosting service. The target audience is anyone looking for those services. There is not target gender. The target age of their audience is generally going to be younger people since the design is built more around the modern look. But really people of any age can use these services.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs </h2>
                <p>The client needs for this website is to create a larger community outreach for the two companies that he co-founded. The site is there just to create more awareness. The user needs are also simple. They are visiting the site for information. Information on the person or information the his companies.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This components is designed for simplicity. It has a white background with grey images linking to this person's social media pages. The images are lined up in a single row, adding to the simplicity, and creating an easy to read quick to figure out footer. Below the images is a line created to separate (hierarchy) the social media links and the text below it. The text is the same light grey color as that social media images (creating continuity). The font is a serif however. This goes against the idea of simplicity and ease of use (since serif fonts are generally a bit harder to read), but I feel is appropriate since this is a personal website and not a company website. Generally companies like to use sans-serif fonts because they are clean and create a sense of reliability and honesty. While personal websites like to use serif fonts because it makes them more "human" and more personal.</p>
