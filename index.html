                <h2>Darrell Liles</h2><br><br>
                <p id="aboutInfo">Hello my name is Darrell Liles and I am a web design and development student at Full Sail University. I love sketching out ideas and watching them come to life with clean and beautifully written code. This site will serve as a component library where I can store design inspirations that will help me to grow in my career.</p>

                <h1>Header</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/53156.html"><img src="../WSP/images/Header.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience is for motorcycle owners or those that may be looking to own a motorcycle.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be simple and easy to navigate which is beneficial for the client and user. If users can navigate the site easy they may stay on the site long enough to make a purchase. The contacts for social media, which is normally seen in the footer is located here inside the header. This allows the user to immediately connect more with the client without scrolling the page.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange that is being used in the header gives off warmth and happiness, combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow. This makes it agressive creating a call to action. The white fonts being used balances the orange by giving off a clean and pure feel.</p>

                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54802.html"><img src="../WSP/images/header2.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who practice hinduism and would like a place to worship.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be subtle and not to take the users attention away from the info given on the home screen. This is why the background is transparent.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange is being used as a attention grabber as the background of the home link. As you hover over the rest of the nav bar you see more orange. The orange is optimistic and uplifting. and gives off an inviting feel. The white font is also used here which represents cleanliness and purity.</p>

                <h1>CTA</h1>
                <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/52490.html"><img src="../WSP/images/CTA.png"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who are athletic and participate physical sports.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The use of this CTA is designed so that the background color would not distract the user from the reading the Tag Line. Once you hover over the button the background color shows up. The technique is called a ghost button.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>Once the CTA button gets hovered over a blue color shows up as the background. The blue gives off a feeling of security and trust. This could help the user feel like they made the right choice to continue. </p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The audience being targeted here are those who are hardcore fishers.  </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>While the design appears to be nice looking, I think the pictures in the back should be a little more visible to avoid the user spending anytime thinking and trying to figure out what the image is.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The blue color used here immediately draws the attention of the user.The black background gives off a strong and secure emotion . The blue gives off a dependable feeling which is needed when the customer begins to view products. </p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Target audience for this about section is likely to consist of professionals  who are looking for a quick way to get in contact with the company. </p>

                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This is a very straight forward design but it is  very effective. The white background gives a clean look and positive vibe while the black lettering gives it a strong elegant feel.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>I dont really think there was a targeted audience in mind for the contact component.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The design is pretty simple and straight forward which is great because the user can get the contact info quickly. The email links are clickable allowing the user to shoot a quick email. </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p> The color white when used here, communicates to the user that the contacts listed are reliable and safe to use.  </p>

                <p>The form is designed as simple as it gets. Any user could fill this out with ease. That would be a win/win for the client and the user. I think the form would work good as a modal.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
				<p> The color white gives the form a clean look. White is a color of protection and can also represent a successful beginning. I think the user would feel these emotions when filling out the login form. </p>

                <h2>Critique</h2>
