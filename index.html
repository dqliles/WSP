                <p id="aboutInfo">Hello my name is Darrell Liles and I am a web design and development student at Full Sail University. I love sketching out ideas and watching them come to life with clean and beautifully written code. This site will serve as a component library where I can store design inspirations that will help me to grow in my career.</p>

                <h1>Header</h1>
                <a href=""><img src="../WSP/images/newsletter.jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience is for bike riders who enjoy riding on different trails </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be simple and easy to navigate which is beneficial for the client and user. If users can navigate the site easy they may stay on the site long enough to make a purchase. </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange that is being used in the header gives off warmth and happiness, combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow. This makes it agressive creating a call to action. The white fonts being used balances the orange by giving off a clean and pure feel helping the viewer to clearly read the text.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who practice hinduism and would like a place to worship.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The header is designed to be subtle and not to take the users attention away from the info given on the home screen. This is why the background is transparent.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The color orange is being used as a attention grabber as the background of the home link. As you hover over the rest of the nav bar you see more orange. The orange is optimistic and uplifting. and gives off an inviting feel. The white font is also used here which represents cleanliness and purity.</p>

                <a href="#"><img src="../WSP/images/Gilt.jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience are those who are athletic and participate in physical sports.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The use of this CTA is designed so that the background color would not distract the user from the reading the Tag Line. Once you hover over the button the background color shows up. The technique is called a ghost button.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The designer used a display typeface that captures the viewers attention. This achieved because the color white is being used against a darker background. The transparent button does not take away from the tagline. Once the CTA button gets hovered over a blue color shows up as the background. The blue gives off a feeling of security and trust. This could help the user feel like they made the right choice to continue along the site. </p>

                <h1>Footer</h1>
                <a href="#"><img src="../WSP/images/footer2.jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The audience being targeted here are a younger generation.   </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The designers did an awesome job here of with the use of text and images.The important things such as their names are in bold, and images are the biggest thing on the page catching the viewers eye.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The pictures are the biggest item on the page and I believe they are trying to make a statement about who they are via their style and poses. Along with the portraits, we are given their names, titles and links to their personal various social media account. Social media gives the user insight about what the user is doing real-time which I think carries more worth than a block of text noting what the designer has done in the past. The names are in bold face and sans-serif making them more prevalent at first glance than the other text. The lesser important information is given a style that gives the page a little personality. The lesser important text is given a italicized and decorative font and visual hierarchy suggest it is less important than the designers name but also should be dually noted. The design works well and provides the user with a to-the-point solutions to the About Me section. </p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Target audience for this about section is likely to consist of professionals  who are looking for a quick way to get in contact with the company. </p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The about page looks very clean and professional making it easy for the user to find the contact info.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This is a very straight forward design but it is  very effective. The white background gives a clean look and positive vibe while the black lettering gives it a strong elegant feel.</p>

                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The blog is designed to be simple and easy on the eyes of the user by adding a read more button. The read more button would take you to another page to read the rest of the content. </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p> The orange color from the cupcake draws in you attention while the gray background of the blog gives off a sense of balance.</p>

                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The design is pretty simple and straight forward which is great because the user can get the contact info quickly. The email links are clickable allowing the user to shoot a quick email. </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p> The color white when used here, communicates to the user that the contacts listed are reliable and safe to use. The different type of fonts separate the info that is clickable from the info thats not clickable.  </p>

                <p>The client needs for this company would be to increase revenue and build/reach out to a larger audience.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
				<p> This component presents the user with a friendly picture of each employee working for the company. It is broken up into a square grid that displays more people in each row depending on the size of the user's screen. When the user hovers over a picture of an employee, they are presented with the name of the employee, their position, and links to all of their social media pages. The font used is a sans-serif adding to the modern clean design. The font and images are white which also adds to the clean design of this component. The image links to social media pages use a rounded blue-green background which adds to the modern feel of the component. </p>

                <a href="#"><img src="../WSP/images/component(3).jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>I think the target audience for this group are also for all ages.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs would be to display their previous work to gain new customers. As a designer, potential customers pay attention to every detail of the designer's website. The client needs the look of the website to be a representation of their quality, while not being the main focus of the site. The user needs to be able to see the designers previous works. They need also do not want to be distracted by the website itself, cause that may be misleading.  </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The design uses a bold sans-serif font as the heading. The background is grey to visually group the separate features together. The features themselves display a picture on top of the project name and description. The picture will be the most powerful tool in persuading the user, as design is a visual art. The project name is colored in purple to denote creativity. The sans-serif fonts used give a modern look and allow for easier reading with the smaller font sizes.

                <h1>Footer</h1>
                <a href="#"><img src="../WSP/images/Footer.jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>This company is targeting those needing medical assistance through primary doctors and specialists. It's targeted toward an adult audience likely to be around age 18 and up and able to make medical choices for themselves or their dependants.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs </h2>
                <p>The medical industry is revenue based. While this organization is a non-profit and does participate in community outreach and informative health events, they do not offer medical services without a cost to the patient. Users of this site will find an enormous amount of information about medical professionals. There are applications available to find doctors based on location, specialty, availability of online scheduling or they can just search for doctors by name. </p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This component and the majority of this site are branded in two colors. The use of blue hues against white as the two primary site colors create a sense of warmth and peace. Red buttons and call to actions create a sense of importance or urgency for the user. Red, however, is only used in the footer when a user hovers over a text link or icon.</p>
